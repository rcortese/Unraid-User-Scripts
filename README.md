# Unraid Scripts Collection

My own personal collection of scripts for Unraid. Intended to be run through User Scripts plugin, these can be directly executed via sh on an Unraid server (tested on v6.9.2).

## alternate_vms.sh

Change from one VM to another from within the VM. Intended to be used for VMs sharing common resources (such as a GPU). Must be run on backgrond, and VM manually shut down within 30 seconds as of now.

First iteration as proposed in a [YouTube video by SpaceInvader One](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoVJ0460cro).
